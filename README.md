# Glioma Segmentation
EE4211 Computer Vision Project - Brain Tumor Segmentation with BraTS 2018

## Data loading
1. Download the BraTSdata2018
2. Extract the .zip file and put it into the subdirectory ```data```
3. Download and extract the .zip file that are the pretrain model weights into the subdirectory ```weights``` from this  <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hE9It0ZOOeIuSFvt6GdiR_0cq9inWdTy/view?usp=sharing">link</a>. The pretrain model is trained and created by the <a href="https://github.com/polo8214/Brain-tumor-segmentation-using-deep-learning">Brain-tumor-segmentation-using-deep-learning</a> project, authored by <a href="https://github.com/polo8214">polo8214</a>.

## Train and Prediction
1. Run the notebook ``` BraTS2018```
